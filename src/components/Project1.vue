      This project was my last one while at Turing and I collaborated with a backend student to build a fullstack application. We decided to build something that would enhance and replace the existing mentoring spreadsheet, which was clunky and not well looked after.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, we came up with a short survey for both those seeking a mentor and those wished to become a mentor themselves. Using that information, we then filtered down the list by location (currently Denver or Remote) as well as by programming language to provide a better search experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our next steps will be to implement a login and tracking system for users, more location and language selections, as well as an admin dashboard.
