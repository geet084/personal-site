      For my last solo project of Turing, I wanted to build an application that would illustrate time and distance in a unique way. Many people do not realize how far they are traveling every second, due to the Earth, Sun, Solar System and Galaxy all moving through space.
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggled quite a bit with Date and Time issues during the project, but was pleased to be able to get a decent (if not always accurate) representation of distance covered through space since a given date.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue to work on this, I would like to have a visual representation of distance pop up in correlation to the number. For example 238,000 miles and a picture of the moon. I would also like to build my own server to use as a way of storing the data and making the experience a bit better.
